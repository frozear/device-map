# device-map
A simple application that plots multiple locations on a single map. Co-ordinates and other data are read from a .csv file.

Enter device list per instructions on the widget or "all", then click the "Map Listed Devices" button.

Alternatively, you can choose a properly ordered .csv file to map. The file should have columns [1] name, [2] latitude, [3] longitude and [4] device type. Column 1 will appear as the pinned name, columns 2 and 3 are required and column 4 will appear as a tool tip when moused over.
